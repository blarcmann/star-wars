      <p> A long time ago, in a city far, far awayâ€¦
      It was a period of heavy clothing manufacturing:
      1986, in Montreal, Quebec. Struck by a dire need
      for large-scale corporate resources planning,
      Stephen Ruby has won his first victory. As one of
      the first fully comprehensive ERP systems in Montreal,
      JAS hit the fashion capital of Canada, and has been
        going strong ever since.</p>
